= Secrets Management

This document outlines the secrets management practices for this repository.

== Types of Secrets

We use the following types of secrets in this project:

1. *Repository Secrets*: Stored at the repository level
2. *Environment Secrets*: Specific to deployment environments
3. *Organization Secrets*: Shared across multiple repositories

== Secrets Storage

All secrets are stored securely using GitHub's built-in secrets management system.
They are encrypted at rest and in transit.

== Accessing Secrets

Secrets can be accessed in GitHub Actions workflows using the following syntax:

[source,yaml]
----
${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}
----

== Current Secrets

|Secret Name |Description |Type |Used In
|GITHUB_TOKEN | Github Token | Implicit Repository Secret | Github Action Build (main.yml)
|GPG_SIGNING_KEY | Gnu Privacy Guard Signing Key | Repository Secret | Github Action Publish (publish.yml)
|GPG_SIGNING_PASSPHRASE | Gnu Privacy Guard Signing Passphrase | Repository Secret | Github Action Publish (publish.yml)
|GRGIT_USER | Github Token to publish to the Github Pages | Repository Secret | Github Action Publish (publish.yml)
|MC_PASSWORD | Maven Central password | Repository Secret | Github Action Publish (publish.yml)
|MC_USERNAME | Maven Central user name | Repository Secret | Github Action Publish (publish.yml)
|SONAR_TOKEN | SonarCloud Token | Repository Secret | Github Action Build (main.yml)

.Github Workflows
|===
| Workflow Name | File Name | Description
| Build   | main.yml  | Continous Integration workflow running build, detekt, tests, integration tests
| CodeQL  | codeql.yml | Runs CodeQL analysis for Java/Kotlin and Javascript/TypeScript
| Publish | publish.yml | Publishes the released artifacts to Maven Central and the Guide and Documentation to Github Pages
|===


[cols="3,3,6", options="header"]
.gradle.properties in user folder
|===
| property name | Value | Description
| systemProp.sonar.hostUrl | https://sonarcloud.io | sonar host URL
| systemProp.sonar.organization | ursjoss-github | Organisation configured in Sonar
| systemProp.sonar.token | | Access token to Sonar project
|===

Those gradle properties are only required if static code analyzis is to be pushed into Sonar from the local device.


== Adding New Secrets

To add a new secret:

1. Navigate to the repository settings
2. Click on "Secrets and variables" under the "Security" section
3. Select "Actions" (for workflow secrets)
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Provide a name and value for the secret

== Secret Naming Convention

* Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for secret names

== Secret Rotation

No generic instructions available.


== Best Practices

1. *Least Privilege*: Only grant access to secrets on a need-to-know basis.
2. *Regular Rotation*: Rotate secrets periodically to minimize the impact of potential breaches.
3. *Avoid Hardcoding*: Never hardcode secrets in the codebase or commit them to version control.
4. *Audit Usage*: Regularly review where and how secrets are being used in workflows.
5. *Use Environment Secrets*: For sensitive production credentials, use environment secrets with required reviewers.

== Security Considerations

* Do not log or display secrets in workflow outputs
* Be cautious when using secrets in pull request workflows from forked repositories
* Consider using OIDC with cloud providers for enhanced security
